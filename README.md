This is a game I made where you cross busy highways where the cars are all going different speeds and directions and crash constantly.

To install, download the latest releases from the releases tab and extract it to wherever you want, then use the .exe file to install the game and once done, delete the extracted files that you downloaded

You can also run this game on Linux if you have Wine or Lutris installed, either add the game to Lutris, or right click the executable and select 'open with' and select Wine
