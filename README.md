This is a game I made where you cross busy highways where the cars are all going different speeds and directions and crash constantly.

To install, download the latest zip release from the releases tab (its in the release description, not under the 'assets' tab) and extract it to wherever you want.

If on Windows, it will come up with a message saying that this file shouldn't be run on your computer, just click 'more info' and then 'run anyway'.

You can also run this game on Linux if you have Wine or Lutris installed, either add the game to Lutris, or right click the executable and select 'open with' and select Wine
